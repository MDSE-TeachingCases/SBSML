# Lab 4 - Code Generation
In this assignment the students have to develop a code generator to transform  **Smart Building System Modeling Language (SBSML)** models to Java code. The metamodel from the [lab 1 sample solution](../lab1) will be used, so all students start with the same metamodel and there can be no disadvantages for any group that did not design complete or deficient metamodels in [lab 1](../lab1). There are [template projects](./template) which have to be imported into Eclipse by the students that are already fully set up and configured. The full description can be found in the [assignment](./assignment.pdf) as well as the [sample solution](./sample_solution).

## Xtend
The code generator will be implemented by using Xtend. To transform **SBSML** models to Java code the students have to implement the already created Xtend files in the [xtend package](./template/sbsml.codegen/src/at/ac/tuwien/big/sbsml/codegen/xtend) in the [sbsml.codegen project](./template/sbsml.codegen). The expected generated code can be found in the [src-gen-expected folder](./template/sbsml.codegen/src-gen-expected).
